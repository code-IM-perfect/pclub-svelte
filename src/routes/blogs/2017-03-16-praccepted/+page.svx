It can be intimidating to contribute to open source. Making a Pull Request (PR) is the first barrier you need to overcome. To encourage everyone, Programming Club is awarding a free T-Shirt to anyone who makes his/her first successful Pull Request to a reputable third party repository.

To qualify for the prize, the repository needs to:

- Be older than 15th January 2017.
- Must be owned by someone outside of IIT Kanpur.
- Must have at least 200 stars in GitHub.

So get to work, and shoot us an email on our [official Email-ID](mailto:pclubiitk@gmail.com) the moment you succeed in getting your first PR accepted!
